This repository contains functions to estimate Bayesian Vector Autoregressions (VARs) implemented in Julia. The main motivation behind this was is to familiarize myself with Julia. I do not claim original ownership of the algorithms and methods behind these codes. Please refer to the references. It is still a work in progress.
